1. In retrospect, what could you have done better to reduce the time you spent solving this assignment?
2. What could the Principles of Software staff have done better to improve your learning experience in 
this assignment?
3. What do you know now that you wish you had known before beginning the assignment? 

1. I could have started the assignment earlier.
2. I wish some instructions for the assignment and expected output were described in a better way.
3. A little more about how Java testing works. It wasn't heard to understand, but having more knowledge of it would have got me through the assignment faster.
