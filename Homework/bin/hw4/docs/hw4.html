<h2 class="western"><a name="Note 1"></a>IMPORTANT NOTES:</h2>
<p>You should have package <tt class="western">hw4</tt> with the
usual directory structure. Write your code under <tt class="western">hw4</tt>
and your tests under <tt class="western">hw4/test</tt> (shows as
<tt class="western">hw4.test</tt> in Project Explorer). If your
directory structure is incorrect autograding will fail resulting in a
grade of 0!</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>This assignment has two parts. In the first part (Problem 1), you
will practice concepts we discussed in class. In the second part, you
will design, implement, and test a graph ADT. Given an abstract,
high-level description of the desired ADT, you will develop a working
Java implementation. You get to choose both the public interface and
internal representation, then decide what unit tests to write to
demonstrate that your implementation works correctly.</p>
<p>Although this is an individual assignment, in the design stage you
will learn more and produce a better design by bouncing your ideas
off others and incorporating their own ideas. To encourage and
facilitate discussion, we are relaxing the standard academic
integrity policy for Problem 2 (the interface design stage). You must
first attempt to come up with an interface design on your own, but
then you are strongly encouraged to discuss your design with your
classmates who have also attempted a design (as well as the course
staff during office hours) as much as you like, without restrictions
on what materials you can bring to or from meetings. On the other
parts of this assignment, including the implementation stage, the
standard academic integrity policy still applies.</p>
<p>This assignment is the first of a multi-part project. In
subsequent assignments you will build several clients of your graph
ADT. By the end of the class, you will build a fully-fledged
application for getting directions to travel between two places of
interest on the RPI campus.</p>

<h2 class="western"><a name="Graph"></a>Building a Graph</h2>
<h3 class="western"><a name="Graph-Definitions"></a>Definitions and
Terminology</h3>
<p>In the rest of this assignment you will design, implement, and
test a <em>directed labeled multi-graph</em>.</p>
<p>A <em>graph</em> is a collection of <em>nodes</em> (also called
vertices) and <em>edges</em>. Each edge connects two nodes. In a
<em>directed graph</em>, edges are one-way: an edge <tt class="western">e
= &#10216;A,B&#10217;</tt> indicates that B is directly reachable
from A. To indicate that B is directly reachable from A <em>and</em>
A from B, a directed graph would have edges <tt class="western">&#10216;A,B&#10217;</tt>
and <tt class="western">&#10216;B,A&#10217;</tt>. 
</p>
<p>The <em>children</em> of node B are the nodes to which there is an
edge <em>from</em> B. In Fig. 1, the children of B are A and C.
Similarly, the parents of B are the nodes from which there is an edge
<em>to</em> B. In Fig. 1, B only has one parent, A. 
</p>
<p>A <em>path</em> is a sequence of edges <tt class="western">&#10216;node1,node2&#10217;,
&#10216;node2,node3&#10217;, &#10216;node3,node4&#10217;, ...</tt>.
In other words, a path is an ordered list of edges, where an edge <em>to</em>
some node is immediately followed by an edge <em>from</em> that node.
In Fig. 1, one possible path is <tt class="western">&#10216;B,A&#10217;,&#10216;A,B&#10217;,&#10216;B,C&#10217;</tt>.
This path represents traveling from B to A to B to C. A path may
traverse a given edge twice. 
</p>
<p>A <em>reflexive edge</em> is an edge which starts and ends at the
same node. In Fig 1. there is a reflexive edge from A to A: <tt class="western">&#10216;A,A&#10217;</tt>.
Your graph implementation must allow for reflexive edges.

</div>
<p>In a <em>multigraph</em>, there can be any number of edges (zero,
one, or more) between a pair of nodes. Fig. 2 shows a multigraph with
2 edges from A to C. 
</p>
<p>In a <em>labeled graph</em> (Fig. 3), every edge has a label
containing information of some sort. Labels are not unique: multiple
edges may have the same label. In theory a graph could contain two
&quot;identical&quot; edges with the same starting point, ending
point, and label, but for this project you may decide whether to
allow identical edges in your implementation. (Whatever you decide,
make sure it is clearly documented so clients understand how they can
use your ADT.) 
</p>
<p>If you want to learn more, read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28data_structure%29">Wikipedia's
definition of a graph</a>. Then if you still have a question, ask us.
</p>
<p>Many interesting problems can be represented with graphs. For
example:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">A graph can represent airline
	flights between cities, where each city is a node and an edge <tt class="western">&#10216;A,B&#10217;</tt>
	indicates that there is a flight from A to B. The edge label might
	represent the cost in money (airfare), time (length of flight), or
	distance. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">To find walking routes across
	RPI's campus in Troy, you can build a graph where nodes represent
	buildings and other locations and edges represent walking paths
	connecting two locations. The label/cost of an edge is the physical
	length of that path. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The Web can be modeled as a
	graph with node for every webpage and an edge <tt class="western">&#10216;A,B&#10217;</tt>
	if page A links to page B. The label could indicate the anchor text
	for a link on page A, or the number of links from page A to page B. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p>Facebook is essentially a giant graph with nodes for users
	and edges between friends. (You can see a <a href="http://www.yasiv.com/facebook">visualization
	of the Facebook graph</a>.) 
	</p>
</ul>
<h3 class="western"><a name="Problem2"></a>Problem 2: Write a
Specification for Graph</h3>
<p>To start, you will specify the API for a Java class or classes
representing a directed labeled multigraph. The API, or public
interface, is the collection of public classes and methods that
clients of your graph ADT will use. We recommend that you work in
iterative layers of detail. Start rough &mdash; preferably with
pencil and paper &mdash; by brainstorming what operations the ADT
needs to support, how it might be logically broken into modules
(classes/interfaces), and how these modules connect to each other.
Then, jot down a list of methods for each class that provide these
operations. Think through some possible client applications,
particularly finding routes between different buildings, to get an
idea about what operations might be needed. 
</p>
<p>Initially you should keep your design rough &mdash; don't write
formal class and method specifications with all the proper clauses
right away. Your design will likely go through multiple iterations,
and it's easier to throw away parts before you've invested too much
effort in them. 
</p>
<p>Once you are satisfied with your high-level design, write a
specification for each class and method. Follow the convention we
have been using in this class, remembering to use both standard
Javadoc tags (<tt class="western">param</tt>, <tt class="western">returns</tt>,
<tt class="western">throws</tt>) and ones introduced in <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse331/13sp/conceptual-info/specifications.html">the
UW handout on specifications.</a> A good approach is to create
skeleton implementations of your classes containing only method
&ldquo;stubs&rdquo;, then write your specifications in place in the
code. A stub is a not-yet-implemented method whose body simply throws
an exception, as you saw in the Homework 3 starter code. Stubbing out
a class gives you the flexibility to write client code and tests that
use it before completing the implementation. The skeleton code will
not behave correctly or pass tests, but the program will compile and
run.</p>
<p>For this assignment, you may restrict your graph to store the data
in nodes and edge labels as <tt class="western">String</tt>s. We
strongly recommend you DO NOT use Generics for this assignment. In a
future assignment, you will use generics to make your ADT work with
other data types &mdash; text, integers, doubles, etc. You may assume
nodes are uniquely identified by their data contents: that is, no two
nodes store the same data.</p>
<p>Design problems such as this one are open-ended by nature: we are
not looking for one &ldquo;right&rdquo; design. There are principles
of good design you have learned in lecture, however. You will also
find suggestions of what to consider and how to approach the problem
in the <a href="#Hints">hints</a> section. Also, designs naturally
evolve as requirements change, so try to make your code extensible,
but don't over-generalize.</p>
<p>Once you are done with the specification of your Graph ADT
(overview and operations) copy and paste your specs and stubs into
the file <tt class="western">hw4/answers/problem2.txt</tt>.<!-- <p>
Please include in your submission a brief description (at most one sentence for
each operation) of why you included the operations you
did and why you feel they are a sufficient interface to a graph. If
your design includes multiple classes or interfaces, explain why you
included each one; if not, explain whether you considered additional
classes and why you decided not to include them. This should be placed
in <tt>hw4/answers/problem2.txt</tt>. The only other deliverables
for this problem are the Javadoc class and method
specifications as they appear in the source code you submit
in <a href="#Problem4">Problem 4</a>; you do not need to submit your
Javadoc in a separate file.</p>
-->
</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="Problem3"></a>Problem 3: Write Tests for
Graph</h3>
<p>Write a black-box test suite for your Graph specifications. It is
important to write your tests <b>before</b> your code, but your tests
will not pass until you have completed <a href="#Problem4">Problem 4</a>.
</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p><strong>Documentation:</strong> Include with your test
	cases one short paragraph of documentation explaining your testing
	strategy, and which (if any) testing heuristics you used. Place this
	writeup in <tt class="western">hw4/answers/problem3.txt</tt>.<!-- TODO: think about authomation in the future --><!-- TODO: specification tests versus implementation tests -->
		</p>
</ul>
<p>Create and commit new JUnit test classes in directory <tt class="western">hw4/test</tt>.
You must have JUnit test classes for <tt class="western">GraphWrapper</tt>
placed into file <tt class="western">hw4/test/GraphWrapperTest.java</tt>.
(<tt class="western">GraphWrapper</tt> is explained in <a href="#Problem4">Problem
4</a>.) Look back to Homework 0 and Homework 3 as examples of
extensive test suites. 
</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="Problem4"></a>Problem 4: Implement Graph</h3>
<p>There are many ways to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28data_structure%29#Representations">represent</a>
a graph. Here are a few: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">As a collection of edges. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">As an adjacency list, in which
	each node is associated with a list of its outgoing edges. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p>As an adjacency matrix, which explicitly represents, for
	every pair &#10216;A,B&#10217; of edges, whether there is a link
	from A to B, and how many. 
	</p>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">In one brief paragraph, describe
	your representation. For at least the three representations above
	and your representation (if it is not one of the ones above),
	explain an advantage of that representation in a sentence. Given
	these advantages, briefly explain why you chose the representation
	you did. You should place this discussion in a file called
	<tt class="western">hw4/answers/problem4.txt</tt>. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Place a proper <b>abstraction
	function and representation invariant</b> for your Graph data type
	(and any other ADTs you create) in your source code. Also implement
	a private <tt class="western">checkRep()</tt> method, which will
	help in finding errors in your implementation. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Provide an implementation of
	your graph data type. We ask that you strive first for a good design
	before worrying about performance right now. Eventually, however,
	your path-finding application will create and operate on very large
	graphs, so the scalability of your Graph implementation will be
	important. Since the path-finding algorithm must frequently look up
	the children for a given node, this operation should be performed
	quickly even for large graph sizes (aim for constant time here).
	Your graph building operations should also be reasonably efficient.
	As your implementation will likely use classes in the Java
	Collections Framework, you should understand the computational
	complexity of classes such as <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html">HashMap</a>
	and <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a>.
		</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Be sure to call your <tt class="western">checkRep()</tt>
	where appropriate. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p>Once you've finished your implementation, you should think
	about whether or not new tests are needed in addition to those you
	wrote before you started coding. If so, you should add these to your
	test suite. You should <b>append to the end of your test strategy
	writeup</b> in <a href="#Problem3">Problem 3</a> a description of
	any new tests you added, or why you feel that your original tests
	alone are sufficient. At this point you <b>must install <a href="http://www.eclemma.org/">EclEmma</a></b>
	(through the Eclipse Marketplace), which measures your code
	coverage. Look for coverage of package <tt class="western">hw4</tt>
	in EclEmma. You must achieve 90% or higher coverage for <tt class="western">hw4</tt>
	to receive full credit on this part. We measure the coverage of your
	test suite --- the higher the coverage, the higher the grade. 
	</p>
</ol>
<p>You have freedom to design the Graph ADT as you wish (you can name
your class, include operations as you chose, choose the rep as you
like). However, we require that you implement an additional class,
<code class="western">GraphWrapper</code> which has an instance field
of type your Graph ADT, and implements the following weakly specified
public methods. You don't have to write rep invariant, abstraction
function or checkRep() for <code class="western">GraphWrapper</code>.
<code class="western">GraphWrapper</code> does not represent an ADT,
it simply redirects the work to your Graph ADT. You do need to write
a test suite <code class="western">GraphWrapperTest.java</code> in
directory <tt class="western">hw4/test</tt>. The purpose of
<code class="western">GraphWrapper</code> is to allow us to test your
Graph ADT through a common interface. Below is the abstract
description of the operations in <code class="western">GraphWrapper</code>.
</p>
<dl>
	<dt><tt class="western">public GraphWrapper()</tt> 
	</dt><dd>
	This is the constructor of <tt class="western">GraphWrapper</tt>. It
	initializes the instance field with a new empty instance of your
	Graph ADT. 
	</dd><dt>
	<tt class="western">public void addNode(String nodeData)</tt> 
	</dt><dd>
	Adds a node represented by the string <tt class="western">nodeData</tt>
	to your graph. If an identical node already exists in the graph, the
	output of <tt class="western">addNode</tt> is not defined, that is,
	it is left at your discretion. 
	</dd><dt>
	<tt class="western">public void addEdge(String parentNode, String
	childNode, String edgeLabel)</tt> 
	</dt><dd>
	Creates an edge from <tt class="western">parentNode</tt> to
	<tt class="western">childNode</tt> with label <tt class="western">edgeLabel</tt>
	in your graph. If either of the nodes does not exist in the graph,
	the output of this command is not defined. If an identical edge
	(same parent, child, and label) already exists, the output of this
	command is not defined either, as it is left to your discretion
	whether to allow identical edges in your implementation. 
	</dd><dt>
	<tt class="western">public Iterator&lt;String&gt; listNodes()</tt> 
	</dt><dd>
	This operation has no effect on your graph. It returns an iterator
	which returns the nodes in lexicographical (alphabetical) order. 
	</dd><dt>
	<tt class="western">public Iterator&lt;String&gt;
	listChildren(String parentNode)</tt> 
	</dt><dd style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">
	This operation has no effect on your graph. It returns iterator
	which returns the list of <tt class="western">childNode(edgeLabel)</tt>

	there is an edge with label <tt class="western">edgeLabel</tt> from
	<tt class="western">parentNode</tt> to <tt class="western">childNode</tt>.
	If there are multiple edges from <tt class="western">parentNode</tt>

<p>To give you some sense of the kinds of issues you should be
considering in your design, here are some questions you might want to
consider. These don't in general have simple answers. You'll need to
exercise judgment, and think carefully about how decisions you make
interfere with each other.</p>

	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Will the graph be mutable or

<p>In choosing what operations/methods to include, strive to include
enough that the ADT will be convenient and useful for a client, but
avoid the temptation to write an &ldquo;everything but the kitchen
sink&rdquo; API. Generally speaking, it is better to design a minimal
than a maximal API. In the real world, you can always add methods
later. However, you can never remove them from a published API, and
such methods may over-constrain the implementation in the future. 
</p>
<p>Make good use of the course staff. If you have concrete questions,
then take your specification to office hours to get some feedback on
your design and style. This is likely to save you a lot of time!</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="Working_Incrementally"></a>Working
Incrementally</h3>
<p>Although it is generally a bad idea to start coding before you
have thought deeply, it often makes sense to work incrementally,
interleaving design and coding. Once you have a sketch of your
specification, you may want to write some experimental code. This
should give you some concrete feedback on how easy it is to implement
the methods you've specified. You may even want to start at the end,
and write the code that uses your type, so that you can be confident
that the methods you provide will be sufficient. 
</p>
<p>This strategy can backfire and degenerate into mindless hacking,
leaving you with a pile of low-quality code and an incoherent
specification. To avoid that, bear three things in mind: 
</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">You must be willing to start
	again: experimental code isn't experimental if you're not prepared
	to throw it away. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Whenever you start coding, you
	must have a firm idea of what you're trying to implement. There's no
	point starting to code to a specification that is vague and missing
	crucial details. That doesn't mean that your specification must be
	complete and polished, but it does mean that you shouldn't start
	coding a method until at least you have its own specification
	written. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p>You <em>must</em> write down the specification of a method
	and not just imagine it; it's too easy to delude yourself. Try to
	write it on paper and mull it over before you start any coding. It's
	tempting to sit in front of an editor, write some specification as
	comments, and then start coding around them, but this tends not to
	be nearly so effective. 
	</p>
</ol>
<h3 class="western"><a name="Designing_Tests"></a>Designing Tests</h3>
<p>It can be difficult to come up with a good test suite. You would
like to test a variety of &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; graphs, but what
are interesting graphs? One possible approach is a &ldquo;0, 1, 2&rdquo;
case analysis: test scripts with 0, 1, and 2 graphs are interesting;
graphs with 0, 1, and 2 nodes and 0, 1, and 2 edges are interesting.
For each method, 0, 1, and 2 parameters and 0, 1, and 2 results are
interesting; for example: addEdge on nodes that currently have 0, 1,
and 2 children; listChildren on nodes with 0, 1, and 2 children;
etc.<!--, findPath with 0, 1,and 2 start nodes, 0, 1,and 2 goal
nodes, and 0, 1,and 2 paths found.
-->
This approach, while certainly not required, can give a good way to
structure your tests to cover many important cases without having too
much redundancy. Use EclEmma to measure your coverate and gain even
more confidence in your tests.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="af-ri-checkrep"></a>Abstraction
function, representation invariant, and checkRep</h3>
<p>Include an abstraction function, representation invariant, and
private <tt class="western">checkRep()</tt> method in all new classes
you create that represent an ADT. If a class does not represent an
ADT, place a comment that explicitly says so where the AF and RI
would normally go. (For example, classes that contain only static
methods and are never constructed usually do not represent an ADT &mdash;
though you are unlikely to write any such classes for HW4.) Please
come to office hours if you feel unsure about what counts as an ADT
and what doesn't. 
</p>
<p>Be conscious of how certain operations in <tt class="western">checkRep()</tt>,
particularly iterating over a large dataset, may affect the &ldquo;big-O&rdquo;
runtime of your methods. If your program suffers performance problems
in Homework 4 or 5, <tt class="western">checkRep()</tt> is a good
place to start looking for problems.</p>
<p>It is hard to balance the utility of the <tt class="western">checkRep()</tt>
method with how expensive it may be to run. A good approach is to
call <tt class="western">checkRep()</tt> as much as possible
(generally at the beginning and end of every method), but to <strong>disable
the </strong><strong><tt class="western">checkRep()</tt></strong><strong>
when you turn in your code so that our tests don't timeout.</strong>
A good way to do this is to have a static final constant variable
that is checked in your <tt class="western">checkRep()</tt> such that
it only runs when the constant variable is set.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="hashCode-Warning"></a>A warning about
equals and hashCode</h3>
<p>You may find it useful to define a class or classes that implement
method equals. If you do that, <em>be sure</em> to also provide a
consistent definition of method hashCode, otherwise your objects may
behave strangely if used in containers like HashMaps. There is a good
discussion of the issues involved in <em>Effective Java</em> (item 9
in the 2nd edition).</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="Generics-Warning"></a>A warning about
using generics</h3>
<p>You are permitted <font color="#ff0000"><b>but discouraged</b></font>
from implementing generic classes on this assignment (that will come
later). A generic class is one defined as something like 
</p>
<pre class="western">public class Graph&lt;N,E&gt; {
   ...
}</pre><p>
where a client could then construct a <tt class="western">Graph&lt;String,String&gt;</tt>,
<tt class="western">Graph&lt;City,Road&gt;</tt>, etc. 
</p>
<p>If you choose to write a generic class, be aware that Eclipse's
built-in compiler sometimes handles generics differently from <tt class="western">javac</tt>,
the standard command-line compiler. 
</p>
<p>This warning is only directed at students writing their own
generic classes. Simply using, say, a <tt class="western">List&lt;String&gt;</tt>
or <tt class="western">Comparator&lt;Foo&gt;</tt> (as you have been
doing all along) should be fine. 
</p>
