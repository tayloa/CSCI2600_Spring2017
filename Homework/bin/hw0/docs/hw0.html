	</h1>
	<h2 class="western"><!-- omit from toc -->Due: Monday January 30 @
	11:59 AM</h2>
</div>
<p>The purpose of this assignment is to help you set up your
development environment, get acquainted with Java, and introduce your
with tools you will use for the rest of the course. 
</p>
<p>If you would like to get more practice with Java, then we
recommend walking through Oracle's Java tutorials described under
<a href="#Problem4">Problem 4</a>. Try to complete Homework 0 first
so you can use the tools we describe here when doing the examples in
Oracle's tutorial. 
</p>
<p>You are free to get help from anyone, on any portion of this
problem set; that is, the <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~thompw4/CSCI-2600/Spring2017/Documents/syllabus_CSCI_2600.pdf" target="_blank">academic
integrity policy</a> does not apply to this homework. 
</p>
<p>If you are having trouble with this assignment, get in touch with
us immediately so we can try to get you back on track.<!-- (Not true in 11wi.)
<p>
The first section will consist of the staff in the lab making
sure people get a solid start on this assignment.
</p>
--><!-- *********************GETTING STARTED*********************** -->
</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="getting_started"></a>Getting Started</h2>
<p><!-- TODO: Double check this paragraph. Is there more? -->You must
have Eclipse and Subclipse properly installed and must have checked
out project csci2600 with package hw0 through SVN. 
</p>
<p>Throughout the course you will receive starter code and submit
your assignments through Subversion (SVN). SVN is a version control
system that allows software engineers to backup, manage, and
collaborate on large software projects (you will learn more about SVN
throughout the course).</p>
<p>Follow the instructions in the <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~thompw4/CSCI-2600/Spring2017/Documents/VersionControl.pdf">Verision
Control handout</a>, which outlines the basics of SVN.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="Problem1"></a><!-- ************************PROBLEM 1****************************** -->Problem
1: Your first Java class&mdash;RandomHello</h2>
<p>Create your Java class with a <tt class="western">main</tt> method
that will randomly choose, and then print to the console, one of five
possible greetings that you define.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~thompw4/CSCI-2600/Spring2017/Documents/EditingCompilingWithEclipse.pdf#new">Create
the file</a> <tt class="western">RandomHello.java</tt>, which will
define a Java class named <tt class="western">RandomHello</tt> that
will reside in the Java package <tt class="western">hw0</tt>; that
is, assuming your project csci2600, its file name would be
<tt class="western"><em>YourWorkspaceDirectory</em></tt><tt class="western">/csci2600/src/hw0/RandomHello.java</tt>.
</p>
<p>Java requires every runnable class to contain a <tt class="western">main</tt>
method whose signature is <tt class="western">public static void
main(String[] args)</tt> (for example, the <tt class="western">main</tt>
methods in <tt class="western">HelloWorld</tt>). 
</p>
<p>A code skeleton for the <tt class="western">RandomHello</tt> class
is shown below. Eclipse will generate some of this skeleton for you
when you create the new <tt class="western">RandomHello</tt> class. 
</p>
<p><tt class="western">RandomHello.java</tt>:</p>
<pre class="western">package hw0;
/**
 * RandomHello selects a random greeting to display to the user.
 */
public class RandomHello {
    /**
     * Uses a RandomHello object to print
     * a random greeting to the console.
     */
    public static void main(String[] argv) {
        RandomHello randomHello = new RandomHello();
        System.out.println(randomHello.getGreeting());
    }
    /**
     * @return a random greeting from a list of five different greetings.
     */
    public String getGreeting() {
        // YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    }
}</pre><p>
This skeleton is meant only to serve as a starting point; you are
free to organize it as you see fit. 
</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="wheel-reinvention"></a>No Need to
Reinvent the Wheel</h3>
<p>Don't write your own random number generator to decide which
greeting to select. Instead, take advantage of Java's <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Random.html">Random</a>
class. (This is a good example of the adage &quot;Know and Use the
Libraries&quot; as described in Chapter 7 of Joshua Bloch's <i>Effective
Java</i>. Learning the libraries will take some time, but it's worth
it!)</p>
<p>Type the following into the body of your <tt class="western">getGreeting()</tt>
method: 
</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Random randomGenerator = new Random();</pre><p>
This line creates a random number generator. (Not a <i>random number</i>,
which comes later, but a Java object that can <i>generate</i> random
numbers. In Eclipse, your code may be marked as an error by a red
underline. This is because the <tt class="western">Random</tt> class
is defined in a package that has not yet been imported (<tt class="western">java.lang</tt>
and <tt class="western">hw0</tt> are the only packages that are
implicitly imported). Java libraries are organized as packages and
you can only access Java classes in packages that are imported. To
import <tt class="western">java.util.Random</tt>, add the following
line under the line <tt class="western">package hw0;</tt> at the top
of your file (after the <tt class="western">package hw0;</tt>
declaration):</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">import java.util.Random;</pre><p>
This will import the class <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Random.html">Random</a>
into your file. To automatically add all necessary imports and remove
unused imports, Eclipse lets you type <b>CTRL-SHIFT-O</b> to <i><b>O</b></i><i>rganize</i>
your imports. Because there is only one class named <tt class="western">Random</tt>,
Eclipse will figure out that you mean to import <tt class="western">java.util.Random</tt>
and will add the above line of code automatically. (If the name of
the class that needs to be imported is ambiguous &mdash; for example,
there is a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/List.html">java.util.List</a>
as well as a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/List.html">java.awt.List</a>
&mdash; then Eclipse will prompt you to choose the one to import.) 
</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="using-random"></a>Using java.util.Random</h3>
<p>Read the documentation for <tt class="western">Random</tt>'s
<tt class="western">nextInt(int n)</tt> method by going to the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/">Java
API</a> and selecting <tt class="western">Random</tt> from the list
of classes in the left-hand frame. Many classes also allow you to
pull up documentation directly in Eclipse. Just hover over the class
or method name and press SHIFT+F2. 
</p>
<p>Use the <tt class="western">nextInt(int n)</tt> method to choose
your greeting. You don't have to understand all the details of its
behavior specification, only that it returns a random number from 0
to n-1. 
</p>
<p>One way to choose a random greeting is using an array. This
approach might look something like: 
</p>
<pre class="western">String[] greetings = new String[5];
greetings[0] = &quot;Hello World&quot;;
greetings[1] = &quot;Hola Mundo&quot;;
greetings[2] = &quot;Bonjour Monde&quot;;
greetings[3] = &quot;Hallo Welt&quot;;
greetings[4] = &quot;Ciao Mondo&quot;;</pre><p>
The <tt class="western">main</tt> method in the skeleton code above
prints the value returned by <tt class="western">getGreeting</tt>. So
if you insert code in <tt class="western">getGreeting</tt> to select
a greeting randomly, when the class is run it will will print that
greeting. 
</p>
<p>When you are finished writing your code and it compiles, <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~thompw4/CSCI-2600/Fall2016/Documents/EditingCompilingWithEclipse.pdf#running">run</a>
it several times to ensure that all five greetings can be displayed. 
</p>
<p>Again, now it would be a good idea to add and commit your new
class to <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~thompw4/CSCI-2600/Spring2017/Documents/VersionControl.pdf#Commit">SVN
</a>. 
</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="Problem2"></a><!-- ************************PROBLEM 2****************************** -->Problem
2: Testing Java Code with JUnit</h2>
<p><!-- <div style="float:right; margin-left:10px;"><img src="junit_failure.png" alt="Screenshot: Run Junit from Eclipse" /></div>-->Part
of your job as a software engineer is to verify that the software you
produce works according to its specification. One form of
verification is testing. <a href="http://junit.sourceforge.net/">JUnit</a>
is a framework for creating <em>unit</em> tests in Java. A unit test
is a test for verifying that a given method in a class conforms to
its specification. In this problem, we will provide you with a quick
overview and simple example of how JUnit works. (Later homeworks will
look more deeply into unit testing.) 
</p>
<p>Open both <tt class="western">../hw0/Fibonacci.java</tt> and
<tt class="western">../hw0/test/FibonacciTest.java</tt>. From the
comments, you can see that <tt class="western">FibonacciTest</tt> is
a test of the <tt class="western">Fibonacci</tt> class. 
</p>
<p>Now <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~thompw4/CSCI-2600/Spring2017/Documents/EditingCompilingWithEclipse.pdf#junit">run
the JUnit test</a> <tt class="western">FibonacciTest</tt>. 
</p>
<p>A window or panel with a menacing red bar will appear, indicating
that some of the tests in <tt class="western">FibonacciTest</tt> did
not complete successfully (see screenshot at right). The top pane
displays the list of tests that failed, while the bottom pane shows
the Failure Trace for the highlighted test. The first line in the
Failure Trace should display an error message that explains why the
test failed (it is the responsibility of the author of the test code
to produce this error message).</p>
<p>If you click on the failure <tt class="western">testThrowsIllegalArgumentException()</tt>,
the bottom pane will switch to the appropriate error message. In this
example, the first line of the failure trace shows that
<tt class="western">Fibonacci.java</tt> improperly threw an
<tt class="western">IllegalArgumentException</tt> when tested with
zero (0) as its argument. (You may have to scroll the pane to the
right to see this). If you double-click on the name of a test in the
top pane, Eclipse will jump to the line where the failure occurred in
the editor pane. Figure out the problem in <tt class="western">Fibonacci.java</tt>,
fix it, and rerun the JUnit test. Eclipse will automatically rebuild
when you make changes, but if you are running Junit from the command
line, you must manually rebuild (compile) <tt class="western">Fibonacci.java</tt>
before you rerun JUnit. In Eclipse, this can be done by following the
<a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~thompw4/CSCI-2600/Spring2017/Documents/EditingCompilingWithEclipse.pdf#compiling">compiling
instructions</a> and then clicking the &quot;Run&quot; button. 
</p>
<p>Use the information in the Failure Trace box to help you continue
debugging <tt class="western">Fibonacci</tt>. Keep a record of what
you did to debug <tt class="western">Fibonacci</tt> as you will have
to answer questions about your debugging experience in the next
problem. After you have fixed all the problems in <tt class="western">Fibonacci</tt>,
you should see a bright green bar instead of a red one when you run
<tt class="western">FibonacciTest</tt>. 
</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="Problem3"></a><!-- TODO: Figure out what to do with this!
<p> Now look at
the JUnit tests that we wrote for <tt>HolaWorld</tt> and
<tt>RandomHello</tt> in <a href="#Problem5">Problem 5</a> earlier. They are called
<tt>HolaWorldTest</tt> and <tt>RandomHelloTest</tt>,
respectively. Ensure that your modified code passes these tests
before you turn in your homework.</p>
--><!-- ***********************PROBLEM 6******************************** -->Problem
3: Answering Questions About the Code</h2>
<p>In a newly created text file, answer some questions about the
<tt class="western">Fibonacci</tt> class. Most programming homeworks
that you will be assigned will require you to submit some sort of
response or write-up in addition to your code. Follow these
<a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~thompw4/CSCI-2600/Spring2017/Documents/EditingCompilingWithEclipse.pdf#new">instructions</a>
to create a text file, named <tt class="western">hw0/answers/problem3.txt</tt>,
with answers to the following questions: 
</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Why did Fibonacci fail the
	<b>testThrowsIllegalArgumentException</b> test? What did you have to
	do to fix it? 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Why did Fibonacci fail the
	<b>testBaseCase</b> test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
	fix it? 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p>Why did Fibonacci fail the <b>testInductiveCase</b> test?
	What (if anything) did you have to do to fix it? 
	</p>
</ol>
<h2 class="western"><a name="Problem4"></a><!-- ***************************PROBLEM 4**************************** -->Problem
4: Getting a Real Taste of Java&mdash;Balls and Boxes</h2>
<p>Until now, we have only been introducing tools. In this problem,
we will delve into a real programming exercise. If you are not
familiar with Java, we recommend working through the Oracle's
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html">Learning
the Java Language tutorial</a>. (Skip the section on generics for
now.) Fragments of Oracle's <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/">other
tutorials</a> may also be useful, specifically &quot;Getting
Started&quot;, &quot;Essential Java Classes&quot;, and &quot;Collections&quot;.
</p>
<p>This problem is intended to give you a better sense of what Java
programming entails. This problem can be somewhat challenging. Don't
be discouraged, we're here to help. And we expect that time spent now
will pay off significantly during the rest of the course. 
</p>
<p>As you work on this problem, record your answers to the various
questions in <tt class="western">problem4.txt</tt> in the project's
<tt class="western">hw0/answers/</tt> directory.</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p><b>Warm-Up: Creating a Ball</b>: 
	</p>
	<p>Take a look at <tt class="western">../hw0/Ball.java</tt>. A <tt class="western">Ball</tt>
	is a simple object that has a volume.</p>
	<ul>
		<li/>
<p>What is wrong with <tt class="western">Ball.java</tt>?
		Please fix the problems with <tt class="western">Ball.java</tt> and
		document your work in <tt class="western">problem4.txt</tt>. 
		</p>
	</ul>
	<p>We have included a JUnit test called <tt class="western">../hw0/test/BallTest.java</tt>
	to help you out. In Eclipse, one of its warnings should help you
	find at least one of the bugs without referring to the JUnit
	results.</p>
	<li/>
<p><b>Using Pre-Defined Data Structures</b>: 
	</p>
	<p>Next, we want to create a class called <tt class="western">BallContainer</tt>.
	As before, skeleton code is provided (see <tt class="western">BallContainer.java</tt>).
	A BallContainer is a container for Balls. BallContainer must support
	the following methods and your task is to fill in the code that will
	implement all these methods correctly:</p>
	<ul>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">add(Ball)</tt>
				</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">remove(Ball)</tt>
				</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">getVolume()</tt>
				</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">size()</tt>
				</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">clear()</tt>
				</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">contains(Ball)</tt>
				</p>
	</ul>
	<p>The specifications for these methods are found in the code
	<tt class="western">BallContainer.java</tt>. 
	</p>
	<p>In BallContainer, we use a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Set.html">java.util.Set</a>
	to keep track of the balls. This is a great example of using a
	predefined Java data-structure to save yourself significant work. 
	</p>
	<p>Before implementing each method, read the documentation for <tt class="western">Set</tt>.
	Some of your methods will be as simple as calling the appropriate
	predefined methods for <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Set.html">Set</a>.
	To help you out, we have included a JUnit test called
	<tt class="western">../hw0/test/BallContainerTest.java</tt>.</p>
	<p>Before you start coding, please take time to think about the
	following question (which you need to answer in the text file):</p>
	<blockquote style="margin-bottom: 0in">There are two obvious
	approaches for implementing <tt class="western">getVolume()</tt>: 
	</blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li/>
<blockquote style="margin-bottom: 0in">Every time <tt class="western">getVolume()</tt>
		is called, go through all the Balls in the <tt class="western">Set</tt>
		and add up the volumes. (<b>Hint:</b> one solution might use a
		<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/language/foreach.html">for-each
		loop</a> to extract <tt class="western">Ball</tt>s from the <tt class="western">Set</tt>.)
				</blockquote>
		<li/>
<blockquote>Keep track of the total volume of the Balls in
		<tt class="western">BallContainer</tt> whenever Balls are added and
		removed. This eliminates the need to perform any computations when
		<tt class="western">getVolume</tt> is called. 
		</blockquote>
	</ul>
	<blockquote>Which approach do you think is the better one? Why?</blockquote>
	<li/>
<p><b>Implementing a Box</b>: 
	</p>
	<p>In this problem, you will do a little more design and thinking
	and a little less coding. You will implement the <tt class="western">Box</tt>
	class. A Box is also a container for Balls. The key difference
	between a <tt class="western">Box</tt> and a <tt class="western">BallContainer</tt>
	is that a Box has only finite volume. Once a box is full, we cannot
	put in more Balls. The size (volume) of a Box is defined when the
	constructor is called:</p>
	<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">public Box(double volume);</pre><p>
	Since a <tt class="western">Box</tt> is in many ways similar to a
	<tt class="western">BallContainer</tt>, we internally keep track of
	many things in the <tt class="western">Box</tt> with a
	<tt class="western">BallContainer</tt>, allowing us to reuse code.
	Many of the methods in <tt class="western">Box</tt> can simply
	&quot;delegate&quot; to the equivalent in <tt class="western">BallContainer</tt>;
	for example, removing from a <tt class="western">Box</tt> cannot
	cause it to exceed its volume limit. This design of having one class
	contain an object of another class and reusing many of the latter
	class's methods is called <b>composition</b>. 
	</p>
	<p>(<b>Optional Note</b>: If you are familiar with Java, you may
	wonder why we did not simply make <tt class="western">Box</tt>
	extend <tt class="western">BallContainer</tt> via &quot;inheritance&quot;;
	that is, why did we not make <tt class="western">Box</tt> a subclass
	of <tt class="western">BallContainer</tt>. We will discuss this much
	more deeply later in the course, but the key idea is that <tt class="western">Box</tt>
	is not what we call a true subtype of <tt class="western">BoxContainer</tt>
	because it is in fact more limited than <tt class="western">BallContainer</tt>
	(a <tt class="western">Box</tt> can only hold a limited amount);
	hence, a user who uses a <tt class="western">BallContainer</tt> in
	his code can not simply substitute that <tt class="western">BallContainer</tt>
	with a <tt class="western">Box</tt> and assume the same behavior in
	his program. (The code may cause the Box to fill up, but he did not
	have this concern when using a <tt class="western">BallContainer</tt>).
	For this reason, it is not a good idea to make <tt class="western">Box</tt>
	extend <tt class="western">BallContainer</tt>.) 
	</p>
	<p>In addition to the constructor described above, you will need to
	implement the following new methods in <tt class="western">Box</tt>:
		</p>
	<ul>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">add(Ball)</tt>
				</p>
		<li/>
<p><tt class="western">getBallsFromSmallest()</tt> 
		</p>
	</ul>
	<p>The specifications for these methods can be found in the code
	<tt class="western">Box</tt>. 
	</p>
	<p>A few things to consider before you start writing code: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">You shouldn't need to implement
		your own sorting algorithm. Instead, take advantage of the Java API
		(remember: &quot;Know and Use the Libraries&quot;). 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Also, you shouldn't need to
		change your implementation of <tt class="western">BallContainer</tt>
		or <tt class="western">Ball</tt> for this problem. In particular,
		you should not implement the <tt class="western"><a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html">Comparable</a></tt>
		interface. If you are tempted to do so, consider using <tt class="western"><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html">Comparator</a></tt>
		instead. <tt class="western">Comparator</tt> is a companion
		interface to <tt class="western">Comparable</tt> and is used
		throughout the Java libraries: check out the sort methods in
		<tt class="western"><a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html">java.util.Collections</a></tt>
		as an example. 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">If you do make any changes to
		<tt class="western">BallContainer</tt> or <tt class="western">Ball</tt>
		for this problem, then explicitly document what changes you made
		and why in <tt class="western">problem4.txt</tt>. 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Be cautious if you plan on
		using Java's <tt class="western">TreeSet</tt>; remember that
		<tt class="western">TreeSet</tt> does not store duplicates, and if
		you provide a <tt class="western">TreeSet</tt> with a <tt class="western">Comparator</tt>,
		it will use that <tt class="western">Comparator</tt> to determine
		duplication. See the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/TreeSet.html">TreeSet</a>
		API documentation for more details. 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Before you start working on
		<tt class="western">getBallsFromSmallest()</tt>, we recommend
		strongly that you consider using <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html">Iterator</a>.
				</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The JUnit test
		<tt class="western">../hw0/test/BoxTest.java</tt> should help you
		out. However, we do not guarantee that the tests we provide will
		catch all bugs in your program.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">There are many ways to
		implement <tt class="western">getBallsFromSmallest()</tt>. Briefly
		describe at least two different ways. Your answers should differ in
		the implementation of <tt class="western">Box</tt>, not in
		lower-level implementation (for example, using an insertion sort
		instead of a selection sort is a lower-level implementation because
		it does not affect how <tt class="western">Box</tt> is
		implemented). Hint: think about different places in the <tt class="western">Box</tt>
		class where you could add code to achieve the desired
		functionality.

5: Turning In Your Homework</h2>
<p>You will turn in the solutions for the problem sets, including
this one, by checking them into your SVN repository. All the relevant
files should be included, for example:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Java source files we provide
	that you change. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Java source code you write. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p>Text files, drawings, or documentation of your code. 
	</p>
</ul>
<p>Each homework will indicate exactly what you need to turn in a
Section entitled &ldquo;<a href="#turnin">What to Turn In</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p><!-- <p>If you add a new file, you must explicitly add it to your SVN
repository. This means that you need to tell SVN to "track this file"
as part of the repository. In addition, you need
to <b><a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~milanova/csci2600/EditingCompilingWithEclipse.html#Commit">commit</a></b>
the file to actually put the contents in the repository. Make sure
that, when you're done, your working copy is committed to the
repository so that we get and grade your most up-to-date version.
</p>

<p>Since files like <tt>RandomHello.java</tt>, <tt>problem3.txt</tt>
and <tt>problem4.txt</tt> are not in your SVN repository, you must add
them. You also want to commit the changes you made to
<tt>Fibonacci.java</tt>, <tt>Ball.java</tt>,
<tt>BallContainer.java</tt>, and <tt>Box.java</tt>. </p>
-->In
Eclipse, usually all you'll need to do is right-click on the hw0
folder in Package Explorer, then select <b>Team &raquo; Commit</b>.
You don't need to worry about files you have added (e.g.,
<tt class="western">RandomHello.java</tt>, <tt class="western">problem3.txt</tt>).
Eclipse will automatically ask you if you want to include these files
in the commit. 
</p>
<p>After completing the above steps, all your code and materials to
turn in should be in your SVN repository. Proceed to the <a href="https://submitty.cs.rpi.edu/index.php?semester=s17&amp;course=csci2600">Homework
Server</a> to complete the submition of the assignment! 
</p>
<p><b>Very Important! </b><span style="font-weight: normal">You </span><font color="#cc0000"><b>must
click the Grade SVN button</b></font> <span style="font-weight: normal">for
your homework to be submitted for grading. Committing the files is
not enough. If you don&rsquo;t click the Grade SVN button to submit
the files, your homework will not be graded.</span></p>
<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Make sure that you have the correct directory
structure. If you break the structure, compilation on the Homework
Server will fail resulting in a grade of 0. At this point, you must
have project <tt class="western">csci2600</tt> with subdirectory <tt class="western">src</tt>.
Directory <tt class="western">src</tt> must have subdirectory <tt class="western">hw0</tt>
and <tt class="western">hw0</tt> must have subdirectories <tt class="western">answers</tt>,
<tt class="western">docs</tt> and <tt class="western">test</tt>.
These show as <tt class="western">hw0</tt>, <tt class="western">hw0.answers</tt>,
<tt class="western">hw0.docs</tt> and <tt class="western">hw0.test</tt>
subfolders of <tt class="western">src</tt> in Project Explorer. The
Java classes (e.g., <tt class="western">Ball.java</tt>) must be in
<tt class="western">hw0</tt>, your text files (<tt class="western">problem3.txt</tt>
and <tt class="western">problem4.txt</tt>) must be in <tt class="western">answers</tt>
and the JUnit test classes (e.g., <tt class="western">BallTest.java</tt>)
must be in <tt class="western">test</tt>.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="turnin"></a>What to Turn In</h2>
<p>We should be able to find the following directories and files in
your <tt class="western">src</tt> directory:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">hw0/RandomHello.java</tt>
	that prints out one of five random messages when its <tt class="western">main</tt>
	method is executed. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">hw0/Fibonacci.java</tt>
	that passes the three tests in <tt class="western">hw0/test/FibonacciTest.java</tt>.
	(Note that you should <b>NOT</b> edit <tt class="western">hw0/test/FibonacciTest.java</tt>
	to accomplish this task.) 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">hw0/Ball.java</tt>,
	<tt class="western">hw0/BallContainer.java</tt> and <tt class="western">hw0/Box.java</tt>
	that pass their respective JUnit tests. (Again, you should not
	modify the JUnit tests, though you are most welcome to read the
	source code to understand what they test for). 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p><tt class="western">hw0/answers/problem3.txt</tt> and
	<tt class="western">hw0/answers/problem4.txt</tt> containing answers
	to the questions in Problems 3 and 4. 
	</p>
</ul>
<h2 class="western"><a name="turnin1"></a>Grade Breakdown</h2>
<p>This homework is worth 50 points. The Homework Server runs the
provided JUnit tests (plus a few additional tests). Test and debug
your code in Eclipse before before committing and submitting on the
Homework Server! If your code passes the tests in Eclipse, then it
should pass them on the Homework Server too.

<h2 id="optional-problems">Optional Tutorial Problems</h2>
<p>
If you have not had much experience with Java, we recommend that you do
these extra <a href="optional-problems.html">Optional Problems</a>
(source code for these problems can be found in the <tt>hw0.optional</tt>
package that came with your <tt>hw0</tt> checkout).
If you do not know Java well, and we are going too fast, 
the optional problems will help you become more comfortable with Java.
</p>
--><!-- <h2 id="debugger">Optional Debugger Tutorial</h2>
<p>
In this part, you will learn to Eclipse's built-in debugger. As the name
suggests, a debugger helps you debug your program by allowing you to "watch"
your program as it executes, one line at a time, and inspect the state of
variables along the way.  In the past, you may have
used <tt>System.out.println()</tt> to probe the state of a variable or find out
whether a particular line is reached. In that sense, debuggers are like an
ultra-super-powerful <tt>System.out.println()</tt>.
</p>

<p>One of the most useful features of a debugger is the ability to
set <em>breakpoints</em> in your program. When you run your program through the
debugger, it will pause when it reaches a line with a breakpoint. You can
inspect the current state of variables, then continue running your program
normally or step through one line at a time to watch the variables change.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open Adder.java. This simple program is supposed to print the sum of two
  user-provided integers. Try running it a few times (or reading the source
  code) and you'll see that it doesn't behave as expected.</li>
  <li>Double-click in the left-hand margin of the class next to the
  line <code>return x - y;</code> A blue circle should appear, indicating a
  breakpoint. (Double-clicking again removes the breakpoint.)</li>
  <li>Run the program in debug mode by using F11, <code>Run >> Debug</code>, or
  the green bug icon in the toolbar. As before, enter two ints (say, 3 and 4) in
  the console when prompted. When your program hits the breakpoint, Eclipse asks
  if you want to open the Debug perspective. Choose yes.</li>
  <li>The debug perspective looks overwhelming at first, but don't worry! In the
  top-right panel, select the "Variables" tab and you'll see the names and
  values of all variables in the current context. The top-left panel ("Debug")
  shows where the program is currently paused, where the current method was
  called, and so on. (This is called the stack trace). Double-click on a method
  name to see the corresponding line in the panel below, where you can view and
  edit your source code. Finally, the bottom-left panel shows the console
  window.
  <p><em>What are all the names and values listed in the "Variables" panel? What
  does the "Debug" panel list as the current method and line number? (Write down
  the text that was highlighted when the Debug perspective first
  opened.)</em></p></li>
  <li>Immediately above the "Debug" panel are several buttons for running your
  program. Mouse over each one for a description. "Resume" (green arrow) causes
  your program to continue executing normally until it finishes or hits another
  breakpoint. If you want to monitor what happens shortly after the breakpoint,
  use "Step Into" and "Step Over" (yellow arrows). "Step Over" executes the
  current line and pauses on the next line. "Step Into" enters any method called
  on the current line so you can execute that method line-by-line. (To finish
  the current method and jump back to the caller, use "Step Out.") Hit "Step
  Over" once to execute the <code>return</code> statement and
  exit <code>computeSum</code>. Hit "Step Over" again to progress to the next
  line.
  <p><em>What are all the names and values listed in the "Variables" panel after
  EACH of the two step overs?</em></p></li>
  <li>Hit "Resume" to allow the program to finish executing. Return to the
  default Java perspective by clicking "Java" in the top-right corner or by
  going to <code>Windows >> Open Perspective >> Other...</code> and selecting
  Java (default).</li>
