<h2 class="western"><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>You will be building a route-finding tool. It will take the names
or ids of two buildings on the RPI Troy Campus, and generate
directions for the shortest route between them, using your graph ADT
to represent buildings and pathways between them. For now you will
provide a simple text interface.  <font color="#ff0000">You will have
to name your main class </font><tt class="western"><font color="#ff0000"><b>CampusPaths.java</b></font></tt><font color="#ff0000">
for testing on the Homework Server.</font></p>
<p>In this assignment, you will practice modular design, writing code
for reuse and design patterns. (As before, you get to choose what
classes to write and what data and methods each should have.)
Specifically, you will practice the model-view-controller design
pattern. 
</p>
<p>For organization, this assignment contains one &quot;problem&quot;
for each logical component you will write. The order of the problems
is not meant to suggest an order of implementation. <b>Carefully
design</b> the whole system before attempting to implement any part.
Design with &quot;low coupling&quot; and the &quot;open/close
principle&quot; in mind: you should be able to extend your system
with a GUI interface, while in the same time the heart of your system
(your model) remains insulated from the change. As always, you should
develop incrementally, which may mean repeatedly writing a bit of all
the parts and verifying that they work together. 
</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="MVC"></a>Model-View-Controller</h2>
<p>You will design your application according to the
model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern described below. MVC is a
variation of the Observer design pattern discussed in class. 
</p>
<p>As you design and implement your solution, please list which parts
of your code belong to the model, the view, the controller, or none
of the above in <tt class="western">hw7/answers/mvc.txt</tt>. Often
this can be on a per-class level, but when a class implements both
the view and controller, you must indicate which methods or lines
logically represent the view and which represent the controller. <em>Be
sure to list ALL classes you write for Homework 7.</em> This just
should be a list of classes; you don't need to write any sentences of
explanation. 
</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="mvc-components"></a>The Three Pieces:
Model, View, Controller</h3>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p>The <strong>model</strong> consists of the classes that
	represent data, as well as the classes that load, store, look up, or
	operate on data. These classes know nothing about what information
	is displayed to the user and how it is formatted. Rather, the model
	exposes observer methods the view can call to get the information it
	needs. 
	</p>
	<p>In general, functionality of a model includes: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Reading data from the data
		source (text file, database, etc.) to an in-memory representation. 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Storing data while the program
		is running. 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Providing methods for the view
		to access data. 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Performing computations or
		operations involving the data and returning the result. 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Updating the in-memory state
		(if the application allows the user to modify data). 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Writing to the data source
		(text file, database, etc.). 
		</p>
	</ul>
	<li/>
<p>The <strong>view</strong> implements the user interface. It
	should store as little data and perform as little computation as
	possible; instead, it should rely on the model for data storage and
	manipulation. The view decides how the user sees and interacts with
	this data. 
	</p>
	<p>Does the user interact with a text interface or a GUI? What does
	the user type and/or click to get directions from one building to
	another? How are those directions formatted for display? What
	message does the user see upon requesting directions to an unknown
	building? These are questions the view answers. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p>The <strong>controller</strong> listens to user input.
	Based on the user's keystrokes, mouse clicks, etc., the controller
	determines his/her intentions and dispatches to the appropriate
	methods in the model or view. 
	</p>
	<p>For a simple interface like in this assignment, the view and
	controller may be intermingled somewhat in code. Don't worry too
	much about the separation there; the key point for now is that the
	model is cleanly separated and reusable. 
	</p>
</ul>
<h3 class="western"><a name="model-view-interaction"></a>Model-View
Interaction</h3>
<p>In general, avoid the temptation to create an oversized &quot;god
class&quot; that does everything for the model. The model may contain
multiple classes, and the view can interact with multiple classes in
the model. Most of the time, any class that exists solely to
represent data is part of the model. For this assignment, you will
likely choose to have one central model class that manages the graph
and does most of the heavy lifting, but you will likely also want
some smaller objects that encapsulate related data. Some of these
objects might be returned to the view so it can access their data
directly, avoiding the &quot;god class&quot; scenario; others might
be used only internally within the model. 
</p>
<p>Your model should be completely independent of the view (UI),
which means it shouldn't know or decide how data is displayed. The
model does know something about what data and operations the
application needs, and it should provide methods to access them;
however, it shouldn't return strings tailored to a particular view
and definitely shouldn't contain <tt class="western">println</tt>s.
Imagine replacing your text UI with a GUI or a
Spanish/Mandarin/Klingon text UI (but with the same English building
names) and ask yourself: is my model reusable with this new view? 
</p>
<p>On the flip side, the view doesn't know anything about how the
model stores data internally. Someone writing a view for your
application should only know that the model somehow stores buildings
and paths on campus and should only interact with the data at this
level. In other words, the public interface of the model should give
no indication that this data is represented internally as a graph.
That level of detail is irrelevant to the view, and revealing it
publicly means the model can no longer change its implementation
without potentially breaking view code. 
</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="Problem1"></a>Problem 1: Parsing the
Data</h2>
<p>We have added two .csv data files to <tt class="western">hw7/data</tt>
to be parsed by your application: <tt class="western">RPI_map_data_Nodes.csv</tt>
and <tt class="western">RPI_map_data_Edges.csv</tt>. The <tt class="western">.csv</tt>
files are comma-separated value files that can be opened in any text
editor, just like <tt class="western">marvel.csv</tt>. Their format
is described in more detail below. 
</p>
<p>As usual, your program should look for files using relative
filenames starting at <tt class="western">hw7/</tt>, e.g.,
<tt class="western">hw7/data/RPI_map_data_Edges.csv</tt>. 
</p>
<p>You will write a parser to load the data from these files into
memory. You may use <tt class="western">MarvelParser.java</tt> as a
general example of how to read and parse a file, keeping in mind that
the new data files are structured differently from the Marvel data
file. 
</p>
<p>The file <tt class="western">RPI_map_data_Nodes.csv</tt> lists all
buildings on campus along with their pixel coordinates on the campus
map. (File <tt class="western">RPI_map_data_Nodes.csv</tt> has two
parts. The first part lists all the buildings on campus, where each
line has four &quot;, &quot; separated fields: 
</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Name, id, x-coordinate, y-coordinate</pre><p>
where <em>Name</em> is the full name of the building, <em>id</em> is
the building id, and <em>x-coordinate</em> and <em>y-coordinate</em>
are the coordinates on the map. There may be spaces in the building
names. 
</p>
<p>The second part of file <tt class="western">RPI_map_data_Nodes.csv</tt>
shows the intersections on the map. The intersections have no name,
hence the name field is empty. 
</p>
<p>The file <tt class="western">RPI_map_data_Edges.csv</tt> lists
pairs of building and intersection ids: 
</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">id1,id2</pre><p>
which means that there is a pathway between the building or
intersection denoted by id1 and the one denoted by id2. Pathways are
bi-directional: <em>id1</em>,<em>id2</em> means that there is a path
from id1 to id2 and also from id2 to id1. 
</p>
<p>Your task is to parse these two files and build a graph that
represents the RPI campus map. For this assignment, you will compute
the length of a pathway from the coordinates of the end points by
applying the distance formula. 
</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="Problem2"></a>Problem 2: The Model</h2>
<p>As described above, the model handles the data and contains the
major logic and computation of your program. For this assignment, a
key function of the model will be finding the shortest route between
two building on campus. This can be accomplished by using Dijkstra's
algorithm to find a shortest path in the graph, where edge weights
represent the pathway length. 
</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="Problem3"></a>Problem 3: The Controller
and View</h2>
<p>In this homework, you will write a simple text interface. When the
program is launched through the <tt class="western">main</tt> method,
it repeatedly prompts the user for one of the following one-character
commands: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><em>b</em> lists all buildings
	(only buildings) in the form <tt class="western">name,id</tt> in
	lexicographic (alphabetical) order of name. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><em>r</em> prompts the user for
	the ids or names of two buildings (only buildings!) and prints
	directions for the shortest route between them. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><em>q</em> quits the program.
	(Note: this command should simply cause the main method to return.
	Calling <tt class="western">System.exit</tt> to terminate the
	program will break the <a href="#Problem4">tests</a>.) 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p><em>m</em> prints a menu of all commands. Feel free to add
	functionality. Our tests cover only the functionality specified
	above. 
	</p>
</ul>
<p>When an unknown command is received the program prints the line 
</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Unknown option</pre><p>
Route directions start with</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Path from <em>Name 1</em> to <em>Name 2</em>:</pre><p>
where <em>Name 1</em> and <em>Name 2</em> are the full names of the
two buildings specified by the user. Route directions are then
printed with one line per pathway. Each line is indented with a
single tab and reads: 
</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">   Walk <em>direction</em> to (<em>Name 3</em>)</pre><p>
where <em>direction</em> is the direction of the pathway and <em>Name
3</em> is the name of the building at the pathway destination. If the
pathway destination is an intersection, print 
</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">   Walk <em>direction</em> to (<em>Intersection id</em>)</pre><p>
<em>Direction</em> should be one of North, NorthEast, East,
SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West and NorthWest. To determine the
direction, compute the angle of the destination from direction north
clockwise (e.g, angle of 90 degrees is East). This angle falls into
one of eight 45 degree circle sectors corresponding to North,
NorthEast, East, etc. For example, if the angle is in the sector
[22.5, 67.5), the direction is NorthEast. Finally, print the total
distance in pixel units: 
</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><em>Total distance: x pixel units.</em></pre><p>
where <em>x</em> is the sum of the (non-rounded) distances of the
individual route pathways.</p>
<p>The total distance should be rounded to three digists after the
decimal point. As in Homework 6, we recommend the use of <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Formatter.html">format
strings</a>. 
</p>
<p>Finally, if one of the two buildings in a route is not in the
dataset, the program prints the line 
</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Unknown building: [Name]</pre><p>
If neither building is in the dataset, the program prints the line
twice, once for the first building and then for the second one. If
there is no route between two buildings, your program should print: 
</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There is no path from <em>Name 1</em> to <em>Name 2.</em></pre><p>
To help with formatting, we have provided the output from a sample
run of my solution in the file <tt class="western">hw7/sample_output.txt</tt>.
This file reflects the exact appearance of the console window after
running the program, and includes both user input and program output.
If you run your program with the user input in the file, the state of
the console should match the file contents exactly (including
whitespace). The sample file and the descriptions above, taken
together, should completely specify the output format of your
program. 
</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="Problem4"></a><!-- <p>
  For this assignment, the logical view and controller may be part of the same
  class.  In this case you must clarify which parts of
  the class are the view and which are the controller in
  <tt>answers/mvc.txt</tt>, as described above.
  Do so by method — or even by line, if
  needed, though we recommend against having a single method contain parts
  of the view and of the controller.
</p>
-->Problem
4: Testing Your Solution</h2>
<p>Unlike in previous assignments, the specification is based solely
on the output of the complete application, as invoked through the
<tt class="western">main</tt> method. This means that your JUnit
tests will be different from previous homeworks. 
</p>
<p>We provide a class <tt class="western">CampusPathsTest.java</tt>.
(You can rename this class as you wish). The <tt class="western">runTest</tt>
method takes as parameter the name of the test files, then constructs
two file names, one for input and one for output. It temporarily
points <tt class="western">System.in</tt> and <tt class="western">System.out</tt>
to these files while it runs your main program. The result is that
commands are read from the input file and output is printed to the
output file. For your tests to run, you simply need to add <tt class="western">@Test</tt>
methods that call <tt class="western">runTest</tt> with the
appropriate argument. Also, you must edit the designated line in
<tt class="western">runTest</tt> to invoke your main method. 
</p>
<p>You will specify the commands for your tests to run in <tt class="western">*.test</tt>
files. These files simply contain the series of input a user would
have entered at the command line as the program was running.<!-- Recall
  from <a href="#Problem3">Problem 3</a> that you can also include blank lines
  or comment lines (starting with #) for readability and documentation, and
  your controller should echo these lines to the output.
 -->
For each test, a corresponding <tt class="western">.expected</tt>
file should contain the output your program is expected to print if a
user entered that input. Use JUnit to run the tests. <tt class="western">runTest</tt>
compares the output in your <tt class="western">.out</tt> file
against the corresponding <tt class="western">.expected</tt> file. 
</p>
<p>Reminder: if a test fails, it is often helpful to look at the <tt class="western">.out</tt>
file. These files are written to the <tt class="western">hw7/data</tt>
directory. It may be helpful to navigate through the file system at
the command line rather than in Eclipse. 
</p>
<p>We have provided one example test in <tt class="western">hw7/data</tt>.
Note that the <tt class="western">.expected</tt> file only contains
newlines printed by the program using <tt class="western">System.out.println</tt>.
</p>
<p><font color="#ff0000">It is important that your test data, i.e.,
</font><tt class="western"><font color="#ff0000">*.test</font></tt><font color="#ff0000">
and </font><tt class="western"><font color="#ff0000">*.expected</font></tt><font color="#ff0000">

and not in directory </font><tt class="western"><font color="#ff0000">hw7/test/</font></tt><font color="#ff0000">.
If you place your test data in </font><tt class="western"><font color="#ff0000">test</font></tt><font color="#ff0000">
the Homework Server won't grab the files and will produce
FileNotFound Exceptions.</font> 
</p>
<p>Additionally, you should write JUnit tests for <em>every</em>
class that is not part of the view or controller. You may not need
tests for the view and controller. One reason is that they typically
have very little functionality &mdash; they act as glue between the
UI (which is hard to test programmatically) and the model.
Furthermore, end-to-end behavior of your application is tested
through the specification tests. You may write additional tests for
your view and controller if you feel there are important cases not
covered by your specification tests, but avoid creating unnecessary
work for yourself by duplicating tests.

<h2 class="western"><a name="Hints"></a>Hints</h2>
<h3 class="western"><a name="other-hints"></a>Best Coding Practices</h3>
<p>Remember to practice good procedural decomposition: each method
should be short and represent a single logical operation or common
task. In particular, it can be tempting to implement your entire view
and controller as one long method, but strive to keep each method
short by factoring operations into small helper methods. 
</p>
<p>Store your data in appropriate types/classes. In particular, you
should <em>not</em> pack together data into a <tt class="western">String</tt>
and then later parse the <tt class="western">String</tt> to extract
the components. 
</p>
<p>Remember that your graph should be completely hidden within the
model. Classes that depend on the model (namely, the view and
controller) should have no idea that the data is stored in a graph,
not even from the class documentation. If you decided later to switch
to a different graph ADT or to do away with the graph altogether (for
example, by making calls to the Google Maps API to find paths), you
want to be able to change the model without affecting the view and
controller, whose job has nothing to do with how the data is stored
or computed. 
</p>
<p>As usual, include an abstraction function, representation
invariant, and checkRep in all classes that represent an ADT. If a
class does not represent an ADT, place a comment that explicitly says
so where the AF and RI would normally go. (For example, classes that
contain only static methods and are never constructed usually do not
represent an ADT.) You very well may find that you have more non-ADT
classes on this assignment than in the past. Please come to office
hours if you feel unsure about what counts as an ADT and what
doesn't. 
</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="Common-Issues"></a>Common Issues</h3>
<p>Do not call <tt class="western">System.exit</tt> to terminate your
program, as it will prevent your specification tests from passing. 
</p>
<p>If you use <tt class="western">Scanner</tt> to read user input
from <tt class="western">System.in</tt>, be sure not to call both
<tt class="western">next()</tt> and <tt class="western">nextLine()</tt>
on the same <tt class="western">Scanner</tt> object, as the <tt class="western">Scanner</tt>
may misbehave. In particular, some students have found that it causes
their programs to work correctly at the console but not when they run
their tests. Using <tt class="western">Scanner</tt> is nether
necessary nor required. 
</p>
<p>Floating-point precision and numeric comparisons: If you do
arithmetic over floating-point values (<tt class="western">float</tt>,
<tt class="western">double</tt>), then an exact <tt class="western">==</tt>
may not work as expected; for instance, in Java, <tt class="western">1.2
* 3.0 == 3.6</tt> evaluates to <tt class="western">false</tt>. Thus,
when comparing computed floating-point values, you should use an
approximate comparison, such as that the ratio between the values is
very close to 1. However, in this assignment you should use <tt class="western">==</tt>.
You are comparing exact floating-point values that are read from a
file, without doing arithmetic over them. Doing an approximate
comparison is even wrong, since it would give someone reading the
code the impression that you are computing approximate values.
