class A {
 	Object m(X y, String s);
 }
class B extends A {
 	X m(X y, String s);      // overrides A (new implementation for child class)                        
 	Y m(Object y, Object s); // overloads A (parameters change)
 	Object m(X y, String s) throws RuntimeException; // overrides A (new implementation for child class) 
 	Z m(Y y, String s);     // overloads A (parameters change)
