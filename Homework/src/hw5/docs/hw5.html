Introduction</h2>
<p>Like Homework 4, this homework has two parts. In the first part
(Problem 1), you will practice concepts we discussed in class. In the
second part, you will put the graph you designed in Homework 4 to use
by modeling the Marvel Comics universe. By trying out your ADT in a
client application, you will be able to test the usability of your
design as well as the correctness, efficiency, and scalability of
your implementation.</p>
<p>The application builds a graph containing thousands of nodes and
edges. At this size, you may discover performance issues that weren't
revealed by your unit tests on smaller graphs. With a well-designed
implementation, your program will run in a matter of seconds. Bugs or
less ideal choices of data structures can increase the runtime to
anywhere from several minutes to 30 minutes or more. If this is the
case you may want to go back and revisit your graph implementation
from Homework 4. Remember that different graph representations have
widely varying time complexities for various operations and this, not
a coding bug, may explain the slowness.</p>
<p>This Marvel dataset was also used by researchers, who published a
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0202174">research paper</a>
showing that the graph is strikingly similar to &quot;real-life&quot;
social networks. 
</p>

<h2 class="western"><a name="MarvelPaths"></a>The MarvelPaths
Application</h2>
<p>In this application, your graph models a social network among
characters in Marvel comic books. Each node in the graph represents a
character, and an edge <tt class="western">&#10216;Char1,Char2&#10217;</tt>
indicates that Char1 appeared in a comic book that Char2 also
appeared in. There should be a separate edge for every comic book,
labelled with the name of the book. For example, if Zeus and Hercules
appeared in (say) five issues of a given series, then Zeus would have
five edges to Hercules, and Hercules would have five edges to Zeus. 
</p>
<p>Your graph should not store reflexive edges from characters to
themselves. 
</p>
<p>You will write a class <tt class="western">hw5.MarvelPaths</tt>
(in file <tt class="western">MarvelPaths.java</tt> in package <tt class="western">hw5</tt>)
that reads the Marvel data from a file (<tt class="western">marvel.csv</tt>),
builds a graph, and finds paths between characters in the graph. You
are not required to write a main method as a driver for your
application; nevertheless, we encourage you to do so, both for your
own convenience and for the satisfaction that comes with creating a
complete, standalone application. 
</p>
<p>As you complete this assignment, you may need to modify the
implementation and perhaps the public interface of your Graph ADT
from Homework 4. Briefly document any changes you made and why in
<tt class="western">hw5/answers/changes.txt</tt> (no more than 1-2
sentences per change). If you made no changes, state that explicitly.
You don't need to track and document cosmetic and other minor
changes, such as renaming a variable; we are interested in
substantial changes to your API or implementation, such as adding a
public method or using a different data structure. Describe logical
changes rather than precisely how each line of your code was altered.
For example, &quot;I switched the data structure for storing all the
nodes from a ___ to a ___ because ___&quot; is more helpful than &quot;I
changed line 27 from <tt class="western">nodes = new ___();</tt> to
<tt class="western">nodes = new ____();</tt>.&quot; 
</p>
<p>Leave your graph in the <tt class="western">hw4</tt> package where
it was originally written, even if you modify it for this assignment.
There is no need to copy files nor duplicate code! You can just
<tt class="western">import hw4</tt> and use it in Homework 5. If you
do modify your <tt class="western">hw4</tt> code, be sure to commit
your changes to your repository. (Subclipse easily takes care of
this.) 
</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="Problem2"></a>Problem 2: Getting the
Marvel Universe Data</h3>
<p>Before you get started, obtain the Marvel Universe dataset.
Download the file from
<a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~thompw4/CSCI-2600/Spring2017/Homework/marvel.csv">http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~thompw4/CSCI-2600/Spring2017/Homework/marvel.csv</a>.
Store the file in <tt class="western">hw5/data/marvel.csv</tt>. 
</p>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>IMPORTANT</b>: Do not commit the
marvel.csv into your repository! There is a limit on each repository
and committing such a large file may break this limit. This is easily
taken care of in Subclipse, you can exclude marvel.csv simply by
removing the check mark during the commit. </font>
</p>
<p><!-- This file is a cleaned-up
version of a TSV ("tab-separated value") file  Instead,
<a href="http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/marvel-universe-social-graph">download
the data</a> from Infochimps, unzip the download, and copy and rename the
<tt>labeled_edges.tsv</tt> file inside to <tt>hw5/data/marvel.tsv</tt>. (Note
that although the download page encourages you to create an account, it does
allow you to bypass that step.)
</p>
-->Take
a moment to inspect the file. A CSV (&quot;comma-separated value&quot;)
file consists of human-readable data delineated by commas, and can be
opened in your favorite text editor or Eclipse. (If you don't have a
favorite text editor, <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>
is a simple, free, easy-to-use option for Windows.) Each line in
<tt class="western">marvel.csv</tt> is of the form 
</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><em>&quot;character&quot;</em>,<em>&quot;book&quot;</em></pre><p>
where <em>character</em> is the name of a character, <em>book</em> is
the title of a comic book that the character appeared in, and the two
fields are separated by a comma. 
</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="Problem3"></a>Problem 3: Building the
Graph [27 points with Problem 4]</h3>
<p>The first step in your program is to construct your graph of the
Marvel universe from a data file. We have written a class
<tt class="western">MarvelParser</tt> to help you. <tt class="western">MarvelParser</tt>
has one static method, <tt class="western">readData()</tt>, which
reads data from <tt class="western">marvel.csv</tt>, or any file
structured in the same format. <tt class="western">readData()</tt>
creates in-memory data structures: a <tt class="western">Set</tt> of
all characters and a <tt class="western">Map</tt> from each book to a
<tt class="western">Set</tt> of the characters in that book. These
are not the data structures you want, however; you want a Graph. 
</p>
<p>I have also included a main method which takes the file name as a
command-line argument and then calls <tt class="western">readData()</tt>.
To add <tt class="western">marvel.csv</tt> as a command-line argument
in Eclipse, go to Run-&gt;Run Configurations. In the Run
Configurations window, choose the &quot;Arguments&quot; tab. In
&quot;Program Arguments&quot;, type <tt class="western">hw5/data/marvel.csv</tt>.
</p>
<p><font color="#ff0000">Later on when measuring coverage, you can
comment out the main method. (As it is never called from the test
cases.) If you choose not to use my parser code, you can get rid of
the file altogether. You do need to substitute with your own parser
code. </font>
</p>
<p>You may modify <tt class="western">MarvelParser</tt> however you
wish to fit your implementation. You may change the method signature
(parameters and return value) of <tt class="western">parseData()</tt>,
or you might leave <tt class="western">parseData()</tt> as is and
write code that processes its output. The only constraint is that
your code needs to take a filename as a parameter so the parser can
be reused with any file. 
</p>
<p>At this point, it's a good idea to test the parsing and
graph-building operation in isolation. Verify that your program
builds the graph correctly before you go on. The assignment formally
requires this in <a href="#Problem5">Problem 5</a>. 
</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="Problem4"></a>Problem 4: Finding Paths
[27 points with Problem 3]</h3>
<p>The real meat (or tofu) of <tt class="western">MarvelPaths</tt> is
the ability to find paths between two characters in the graph. Given
the name of two characters, <tt class="western">MarvelPaths</tt>
searches for and returns a path through the graph connecting them.
How the path is subsequently used, or the format in which it is
printed out, depends on the requirements of the particular
application using <tt class="western">MarvelPaths</tt>. 
</p>
<p>Your program should return the shortest path found via
breadth-first search (BFS). A BFS from node u to node v visits all of
u's neighbors first, then all of u's neighbors' neighbors', then all
of u's neighbors' neighbors', and so on until v is found or all nodes
with a path from u have been visited. Below is a general BFS
pseudocode algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a
graph G. For readability, you should use more descriptive variable
names in your actual code than are needed in the pseudocode:</p>
<pre class="western">    start = starting node
    dest = destination node
    Q = queue, or &quot;worklist&quot;, of nodes to visit: initially empty
    M = map from nodes to paths: initially empty.
        // Each key in M is a visited node.
        // Each value is a path from start to that node.
        // A path is a list; you decide whether it is a list of nodes, or edges,
        // or node data, or edge data, or nodes and edges, or something else.
    
    Add start to Q
    Add start-&gt;[] to M (start mapped to an empty list)
    while Q is not empty:
        dequeue next node n
        if n is dest
            return the path associated with n in M
        for each edge e=&#10216;n,m&#10217;:
            if m is not in M, i.e. m has not been visited:
                let p be the path n maps to in M
                let p' be the path formed by appending e to p
                add m-&gt;p' to M
                add m to Q
            
    If the loop terminates, then no path exists from start to dest.
    The implementation should indicate this to the client.</pre><p>
Here are some facts about the algorithm. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">It is a loop invariant that
	every element of Q is a key in M 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">If the graph were not a
	multigraph, the for loop could have been equivalently expressed as
	<tt class="western">for each neighbor m of n:</tt> 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p>If a path exists from start to dest, then the algorithm
	returns a shortest path. 
	</p>
</ul>
<p>Many character pairs will have multiple paths. <strong>For grading
purposes, your program should return the lexicographically
(alphabetically) least path. </strong>More precisely, it should pick
the lexicographically first character at each next step in the path,
and if those characters appear in several comic books together, it
should print the lexicographically lowest title of a comic book that
they both appear in. The BFS algorithm above can be easily modified
to support this ordering: in the for-each loop, visit edges in
increasing order of <em>m</em>'s character name, with edges to the
same character visited in increasing order of comic book title. This
is <em>not</em> meant to imply that your graph should store data in
this order; it is merely a convenience for grading. 
</p>
<p>Because of this application-specific behavior, you should
implement your BFS algorithm in <tt class="western">MarvelPaths</tt>
rather than directly in your graph, as other hypothetical
applications that might need BFS probably would not need this special
ordering. Further, other applications using the graph ADT might need
to use a different search algorithm, so we don't want to hard-code a
particular search algorithm in the graph ADT. 
</p>
<p>Using the full Marvel dataset, your program must be able to
construct the graph and find a path in just a couple of seconds on
your PC/laptop and on the Homework Server. When running tests we will
set a 60 second timeout for each test suite. Note that if your
solution exceeds the limit on the Homework Server, your process is
cut then the output file is cut as well resulting in a grade of 0 and
an Error message complaining about incorrect formatting of the output
file. 
</p>
<p>Similarly to Homework 4, add an instance field that stores a Graph
in <tt class="western">MarvelPaths</tt>. For testing purposes, we
require that you implement the following public methods in
<tt class="western">MarvelPaths</tt>. Otherwise, design class
<tt class="western">MarvelPaths</tt> as you wish and add operations
as you wish. 
</p>
<dl>
	<dt style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><tt class="western">public void
	createNewGraph(String filename)</tt> 
	</dt></dl>
<p>
The method creates a brand new graph in the instance field in
<tt class="western">MarvelPaths</tt> and populates the graph from
<i>filename</i>, where <i>filename</i> is a data file of the format
defined for <tt class="western">marvel.csv</tt> and is located in the
<tt class="western">hw5/data</tt> directory of your project. 
</p>
<dl>
	<dt style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><tt class="western">public String
	findPath(String </tt><tt class="western"><i>node1</i></tt><tt class="western">,
	String </tt><tt class="western"><i>node2</i></tt><tt class="western">)</tt>
		</dt></dl>
<p>
Find the shortest path from <i>node1</i> to <i>node2</i> in the graph
using your breadth-first search algorithm. 
</p>
<p>Paths should be chosen using the lexicographic ordering described
above. If a path is found, the returned String should contain the
path in the format below. That is,
<tt class="western">System.out.println(mp.findPath(&quot;CHAR1&quot;,&quot;CHARN&quot;)</tt>
where <tt class="western">mp</tt> refers to an instance of
<tt class="western">MarpvelPaths</tt>, prints the following: 
</p>
<pre class="western">path from <em>CHAR1</em> to <em>CHARN</em>:
<em>CHAR1</em> to <em>CHAR2</em> via <em>BOOK1</em>
<em>CHAR2</em> to <em>CHAR3</em> via <em>BOOK2</em>
...
<em>CHARN-1</em> to <em>CHARN</em> via <em>BOOKN-1</em></pre><p>
where <em>CHAR1</em> is the first node listed in the arguments to
findPath, <em>CHARN</em> is the second node listed in the arguments,
and <em>BOOKK</em> is the title of a book that <em>CHARK</em> and
<em>CHARK+1</em> appeared in. 
</p>
<p>For example, <tt class="western">mp.findPath(&quot;Zena&quot;,&quot;Zeus&quot;)</tt>
will construct and return the String <tt class="western">&quot;path
from Zena to Zeus:\nZena to Hercules via Book1\nHercules to Zeus via
Book2\n&quot;</tt>. (I'm just making this up to illustrate the
placement of newline characters, there is no such a path in the
Marvel universe.) 
</p>
<p>Not all characters may have a path between them. If the user gives
two valid node arguments that have no path in the specified graph,
output the following as String:</p>
<pre class="western">path from <em>CHAR 1</em> to <em>CHAR N</em>:
no path found</pre><p>
If a character name <em>CHAR</em> was not in the original dataset,
simply output:</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">unknown character <em>CHAR</em></pre><p>
If neither character is in the original dataset, output the line
twice: first for the first node, then for the second one. These
should be the only lines your program produces in this case &mdash;
i.e., do not output the regular &quot;path from ...&quot; or &quot;path
not found&quot; output too. 
</p>
<p>What if the user asks for the path from a character in the dataset
to itself? A trivially empty path is different from no path at all,
so the &quot;no path found&quot; output isn't appropriate here. But
there are no edges to print, either. So you should output the header
line 
</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">path from <em>C</em> to <em>C</em>:</pre><p>
but nothing else. (Hint: a well-written solution requires no special
handling of this case.) 
</p>
<p>This only applies to characters in the dataset: a request for a
path from a character that is not in the dataset to itself should
have the the usual &quot;unknown character <em>C</em>&quot; output.</p>
<p>In all cases the string should end with <tt class="western">\n</tt>
(newline), just like in the first case.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="Problem5"></a>Problem 5: Testing Your
Solution [12 points]</h3>
<p>Because the Marvel graph contains literally thousands of nodes and
hundreds of thousands of edges, using it for correctness testing is
probably a bad idea. By contrast, using it for scalability testing is
a great idea, but should come after correctness testing has been
completed using much smaller graphs. In addition, it is important to
be able to test your parsing/graph-building and BFS operations in
isolation, separately from each other.<!-- For these reasons,
you will use a test driver to verify the correctness of both your parser and BFS
algorithm on much smaller graphs, as you did in Homework 4.
-->
</p>
<p>You should first write <tt class="western">*.csv</tt> files in the
<a href="#Problem2">format</a> defined for <tt class="western">marvel.csv</tt>
to test your <tt class="western">MarvelPaths</tt>. All these files
will go in the <tt class="western">hw5/data</tt> directory. 
</p>
<p>Write tests in the regular JUnit test class. Make sure that you
handle the edge cases. You will have to specify data files to load in
your implementation tests, <font color="#ff0000"><b>so make sure you
read the <a href="#File-Paths">File Paths</a> section for information
about specifying filenames very carefully.</b></font> 
</p>
<p>As in Homework 4, run EclEmma and measure coverage of your tests.
We will be measuring coverage in the Homework Server.

<p>Behavior may vary from one version of Eclipse to another. As long
as you hardcode your relative paths starting at <tt class="western">hw5/data</tt>
you will be fine on the Homework Server.

<h3 class="western"><a name="Performance"></a>Performance</h3>
<p>If your program takes an excessively long time to construct the
graph for the full Marvel dataset, first make sure that it parses the
data and builds the graph correctly for a very small dataset. If it
does, here are a few questions to consider: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">What data structures are you
	using in your graph? What is their &quot;big-O&quot; runtime? Are
	there others that are better suited to the purpose? 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Did you remember to correctly
	override <tt class="western">hashCode()</tt> if you overrode
	<tt class="western">equals()</tt>? 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p>What is the &quot;big-O&quot; runtime of your <tt class="western">checkRep()</tt>
	function? Does performance improve if you comment it out? 
	</p>
</ul>
<h3 class="western"><a name="Miscellaneous"></a>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>As always, remember to:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Use descriptive variables names
	(especially in the BFS algorithm) and inline comments as
	appropriate. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p>Include an abstraction function, representation invariant,
	and checkRep in all classes that represent an ADT. If a class does
	not represent an ADT, place a comment that explicitly says so where
	the AF and RI would normally go. (For example, classes that contain
	only static methods and are never constructed usually do not
	represent an ADT.) Please come to office hours if you feel unsure
	about what counts as an ADT and what doesn't. 
	</p>
</ul>
<h2 class="western"><a name="Turnin"></a>What to Submit</h2>
<p>You should add and commit the following files to SVN:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">hw5/MarvelPaths.java</tt>
		</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">hw5/*.java</tt>
	<em>[Other classes you create, if any (there may be none!)]</em> 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">hw5/answers/problem1.txt</tt>
		</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">hw5/answers/changes.txt</tt>

	<li/>
<p><tt class="western">hw5/test/*Test.java</tt> <em>[JUnit
	tests classes you create]</em> 
	</p>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, be sure to commit any updates you may have made to
the following files, so the staff has the correct version for this
assignment:</p>
