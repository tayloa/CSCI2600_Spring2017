Problem 4

Ball.Java
In Ball(), the initialization function, set this.volume to volume instead of volume to volume.
In getVolume(),return this.volume instead of 0.

Which approach do you think is the better one? Why?
Method 2 was more efficient. This way you wouldn't have to iterate through the entire set each time
you wanted to know the volume of the container.


There are many ways to implement getBallsFromSmallest(). Briefly describe at least two 
different ways.Which of the above ways do you think is the best? Why? 

1. Add a private TreeSet variable to hold the balls. Each time a ball is added, add it to the Ball Container and TreeSet. In 
   getBallsFromSmallest(),return an iterator to the set.
2. Create a private sorted ArrayList in the Box class. Each time a ball is added,it goes in the Ball Container and the AarrayList.
   The ArrayList is ordered smallest to largest and readjusted with the addition of each ball. getBallsfromSmallest() will then 
   return the iterator to the start of the ArrayList.

I think method 1 would be better. You wouldn't need to call a sort each time you added a ball like you would in method 2.
