Problem 3

1.Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException test? What did you have to do to fix it? 
-I Changed from (n <= 0)to (n < 0). 0 is not a negative number.

2.Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix it? 
-Fibonacci of 0 and 1 should both return 1. I broke the statement n <= 2 into a check for n == 0 and n == 1.
Both return 1.

3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix it?
-The recursive Fibonacci call at the end was incorrect. It needed to be + instead of -.
