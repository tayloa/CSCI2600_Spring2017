you begin work. As always, you must commit to your SVN repository,
then submit through the Homework server.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>This homework focuses on reading and interpreting specifications,
and reading and writing Java source code. Additionally, you will be
given an introduction to using <tt class="western">checkRep</tt>
methods and testing strategies. You will implement one class that
will complete the implementation of a polynomial with rational
coefficients, and you will answer questions about both the code you
are given and the code you are going to write.</p>

<h2 class="western"><a name="Problems"></a>Problems</h2>
<p>You should have files <tt class="western">RatNum.java</tt> and
<tt class="western">RatPoly.java</tt> in directory hw3, and files
<tt class="western">RatNumTest.java</tt>, <tt class="western">RatPolyTest.java</tt>
and <tt class="western">RatPolyDivideTest.java</tt> in directory
hw3.test. (<tt class="western">RatPolyDivideTest.java</tt> is only
needed for the extra credit problem which asks for polynomial
division. It shows errors because the division operation has not been
added yet to <tt class="western">RatPoly.java</tt>.) Read through the
spcifications in <tt class="western">RatNum.java</tt> and
<tt class="western">RatPoly.java</tt> to help you work through the
problems below. 
</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="Problem-1"></a>Problem 1: RatNum (5pts)</h3>
<p>For this first problem you don't have to write any code, but you
do have to answer written questions. Read the specifications and
provided implementation in <tt class="western">RatNum.java</tt>, a
class representing rational numbers. 
</p>
<p>You may want to look at the code in <tt class="western">RatNumTest.java</tt>
to see example usages of the RatNum class (albeit in the context of a
test driver, rather than application code).</p>
<p>Answer the following questions, writing your answers in the file
<tt class="western">hw3/answers/problem1.txt</tt>. <strong>Two or
three sentences should be enough to answer each question. For full
credit your answers should be short and to the point. Points will be
deducted for answers that are excessively long or contain irrelevant
information.</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Classify each public method of
	RatNum as a <i>creator</i>, <i>observer</i>, <i>producer</i> or
	<i>mutator</i>. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">What is the point of the
	one-line comments inside the <tt class="western">add</tt>, <tt class="western">sub</tt>,
	<tt class="western">mul</tt>, and <tt class="western">div</tt>
	methods? 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">add</tt>,
	<tt class="western">sub</tt>, <tt class="western">mul</tt>, and <tt class="western">div</tt>
	all require that &quot;arg != null&quot;. This is because all of the
	methods access fields of 'arg' without checking if 'arg' is null
	first. But the methods also access fields of 'this' without checking
	for null; why is &quot;this != null&quot; absent from the
	requires-clause for the methods? 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">RatNum.div(RatNum)</tt>
	checks whether its argument is NaN (not-a-number).
	<tt class="western">RatNum.add(RatNum)</tt> and <tt class="western">RatNum.mul(RatNum)</tt>
	do not do that. Explain. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Why is <tt class="western">RatNum.valueOf(String)</tt>
	a static method? What alternative to static methods would allow one
	to accomplish the same goal of generating a RatNum from an input
	String? 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p>Imagine that the representation invariant were weakened so
	that we did not require that the <tt class="western">numer</tt> and
	<tt class="western">denom</tt> fields be stored in reduced form.
	This means that the method implementations could no longer assume
	this invariant held on entry to the method, but they also no longer
	would be required to enforce the invariant on exit. The new rep
	invariant would then be: 
	</p>
	<pre class="western" style="margin-right: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0.2in">// Rep Invariant for every RatNum r: ( r.denom &gt;= 0 )</pre><p>
	List the method or constructor implementations that would have to
	change. For each changed piece of code, describe the changes
	informally, and indicate how much more or less complex (in terms of
	code clarity and/or execution efficiency) the result would be. Note
	that the new implementations must still adhere to the given spec; in
	particular, <tt class="western">RatNum.toString()</tt> needs to
	output fractions in reduced form.<!--(Hint: also, <tt>2/4</tt> must still equal
<tt>1/2</tt>.)-->
		</p>
	<li/>
<p><tt class="western">add</tt>, <tt class="western">sub</tt>,
	<tt class="western">mul</tt>, and <tt class="western">div</tt> all
	end with a statement of the form <code class="western">return new
	RatNum ( numerExpr , denomExpr);</code>. Imagine an implementation
	of the same function except the last statement is: 
	</p>
	<pre class="western" style="margin-right: 0.39in">this.numer = numerExpr;
this.denom = denomExpr;
return this;</pre><p>
	For this question, pretend that the <tt class="western">this.numer</tt>
	and <tt class="western">this.denom</tt> fields are not declared as
	<tt class="western">final</tt> so that these assignments compile
	properly. How would the above changes fail to meet the
	specifications of the function (Hint: take a look at the <tt class="western">@requires</tt>
	and <tt class="western">@modifies</tt> statements, or lack thereof.)
	and fail to meet the specifications of the RatNum class?</p>
	<li/>
<p>Calls to <tt class="western">checkRep</tt> are supposed to
	catch violations in the classes' invariants. In general, it is
	recommended that one call <tt class="western">checkRep</tt> at the
	beginning and end of every method. In the case of <tt class="western">RatNum</tt>,
	why is it sufficient to call <tt class="western">checkRep</tt> only
	at the end of the constructors? (Hint: could a method ever modify a
	<tt class="western">RatNum</tt> such that it violates its
	representation invariant? Could a method change a <tt class="western">RatNum</tt>
	at all? How are changes to instances of <tt class="western">RatNum</tt>
	prevented?) 
	</p>
</ol>
<h3 class="western"><a name="Problem-2"></a>Problem 2: RatPoly
(45pts: Code: 40pts autograded, Answers: 5pts)</h3>
<p>Read over the specifications for the <tt class="western">RatPoly</tt>
class, making sure you understand the overview for RatPoly and the
specifications for the given methods. Read through the provided
skeletal implementation of <tt class="western">RatPoly.java</tt>. 
</p>
<p>Fill in an implementation for all methods.<!-- except for 
<code>differentiate()</code>, <code>antiDifferentiate(RatNum integrationConstant)</code>
and <code>integrate(double lowerBound, double upperBound)</code>. If implement you
these three methods you will earn 10 points extra credit for the assignment.
-->
</p>
<p>You may define new private helper methods as you like.<!--; we have suggested
a few ourselves, complete with specifications, but you are not obligated
to use them. (We believe that doing so will simplify
your implementation.)-->
You may not add public methods; the external interface must remain
the same. (If you implement the Extra credit question you will have
to add one specific public method.) If you define new methods, you
must specify them completely. You can consider the specifications of
existing methods (where you fill in the body) to be adequate. You
should comment any code you write, as needed; please do not
over-comment. 
</p>
<p>We have provided a <tt class="western">checkRep()</tt> method in
RatPoly that tests whether or not a RatPoly instance violates the
representation invariants. We highly recommend you use <tt class="western">checkRep()</tt>
where appropriate in the code you write. Think about the issues
discussed in the last question of problem 1 when deciding where
<tt class="western">checkRep</tt> should be called. 
</p>
<p><!--<p>Take a look
at the RatPoly.degree() function for a simple way to include
<tt>checkRep()</tt> in your code.  Simply place the entire main body
of your code inside a <tt>try { ... }</tt> block, and append <pre>
finally {
    checkRep();
}</pre>
to your code.</p>
-->There
is a fairly rigorous test suite in <tt class="western">RatPolyTest.java</tt>.
You can run the given test suite with JUnit to evaluate your progress
and the correctness of your code. It is probably a good idea to run
tests individually rather than runnning the entire suite at once.</p>
<p>Answer the following questions, writing your answers in the file
<tt class="western">hw3/answers/problem2.txt</tt>. <strong>Remember,
keep your answers to 2-3 sentences.</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">We have chosen the array
	representation of a polynomial: <code class="western">RatNum[]
	coeffs</code>, where <code class="western">coeffs[i]</code> stores
	the coefficient of the term of exponent <code class="western">i</code>.
	An alternative data representation is the list-of-terms
	representation: <code class="western">List&lt;Term&gt; terms</code>,
	where each Term object stores the term's RatNum coefficient and
	integer exponent. The beauty of the ADT methodology is that we can
	switch from one representation to the other without affecting the
	clients of our RatPoly! Briefly list the advantages and
	disadvantages of the array representation versus the list-of-terms
	representation. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Where did you include calls to
	<tt class="western">checkRep</tt> (at the beginning of methods, the
	end of methods, the beginning of constructors, the end of
	constructors, some combination)? Why? 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p>Imagine that the representation invariant of <tt class="western">RatPoly</tt>
	was weakened so that we did not require the last element of <code class="western">coeffs</code>
	to be non-0. This means that the method implementations could no
	longer assume this invariant held on entry to the method, but they
	also no longer were required to enforce the invariant on exit. Which
	method or constructor implementations will change? Please list them.
	For each changed piece of code, describe the changes informally, and
	indicate how much more or less complex (in terms of code clarity
	and/or execution efficiency) the result would be. Note that the new
	implementations must still adhere to the given spec. 
	</p>
</ol>
<h3 class="western"><a name="Problem 3"></a>Problem 3: Polynomial
division (10pts EXTRA CREDIT: Pseudocode and invariant: 5pts, Java
code: 5pts autograded)</h3>
<p>Write a pseudocode algorithm for division. State the loop
invariant for the main loop. You do not need to prove partial
correctness, just give the right invariant. Write your answer in the
file <tt class="western">hw3/answers/problem3.txt</tt>. 
</p>
<p>The following is the definition of polynomial division: 
</p>
<blockquote>Division of polynomials is defined as follows:</blockquote>
<blockquote>Given two polynomials u and v, with v != &quot;0&quot;,
we can divide u by v to obtain a quotient polynomial q and a
remainder polynomial r satisfying the condition u = &quot;q * v + r&quot;,
where the degree of r is strictly less than the degree of v, the
degree of q is no greater than the degree of u, and r and q have no
negative exponents.</blockquote>
<blockquote>For the purposes of this class, the operation &quot;u /
v&quot; returns q as defined above.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The following are examples of div's behavior:</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li/>
<blockquote style="margin-bottom: 0in">(x^3-2*x+3) / (3*x^2) =
	1/3*x (with r = &quot;-2*x+3&quot;). 
	</blockquote>
	<li/>
<blockquote style="margin-bottom: 0in">(x^2+2*x+15) / (2*x^3)
	= 0 (with r = &quot;x^2+2*x+15&quot;). 
	</blockquote>
	<li/>
<blockquote>(x^3+x-1) / (x+1) = x^2-x+2 (with r = &quot;-3&quot;).
		</blockquote>
</ul>
<blockquote>Note that this truncating behavior is similar to the
behavior of integer division on computers.</blockquote>
<p>For this question, you do not need to handle division by zero;
however, you will need to do so for the Java programming exercise. 
</p>
<p>Next, add a public method <tt class="western">public RatPoly
div(RatPoly p)</tt> with appropriate specification to the <tt class="western">RatPoly</tt>
class and transfer your pseudocode algorithm into <tt class="western">div</tt>.
You may assume that the divisor <tt class="western">p</tt> is
non-null. If <tt class="western">p</tt> is zero <tt class="western">div</tt>
returns some <tt class="western">q</tt> such that <tt class="western">q.isNaN</tt>.
As with the other operations (e.g., <tt class="western">mul</tt>), if
<tt class="western">this.isNaN</tt> or <tt class="western">p.isNaN</tt>,
<tt class="western">div</tt> returns some <tt class="western">q</tt>
such that <tt class="western">q.isNaN</tt>. 
</p>
<p>There is an extensive test suite for division in
<tt class="western">RatPolyDivideTest.java</tt>. You can run this
test suite to evaluate your progress and the correctness of your
code.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="collaboration"></a><!-- Will include in futre iters. of PoS!!!
<h3 id="Problem-6">Problem 6: Invariant detection (4 points)</h3>

<p> Daikon is a software engineering tool that reports properties
about programs similar to representation invariants and method pre-
and postconditions.  Please read the <a
href="../../tools/daikon.html">introduction to Daikon</a>.  </p>

<p> For this problem, you will generate and analyze the results of
running Daikon on the <tt>RatNum</tt> class using two different test suites:
<tt>RatNumTest</tt>, the original test suite, and
<tt>RatNumSmallTest</tt>, a reduced test suite that does not provide as much coverage.</p>

<p> To ease your work, we have provided you with <tt>ant</tt> targets
to run Daikon with the correct arguments for this particular problem.
Like most of the other targets (e.g. "build"), these targets can be run from
either <a href="../../tools/editing-compiling.html#ant-eclipse">Eclipse</a> or the command line.
</p>

<p>First, run Daikon from your hw3 directory using the original RatNum test suite (<tt>RatNumTest</tt>):</p>
<pre>
ant daikon-RatNumTest
</pre>

<p>This command will place Daikon's results in
<tt>daikon-RatNumTest.inv.txt</tt> in your <tt>hw3</tt> directory.
If you are using Eclipse, you will need to refresh the <tt>hw3</tt> directory
to see the results file in the <b>Package Browser</b>.</p>

<p> Next, run Daikon on the reduced RatNum test suite (<tt>RatNumSmallTest</tt>):</p>
<pre>
ant daikon-RatNumSmallTest
</pre>

<p>This command will place Daikon's results in
<tt>daikon-RatNumSmallTest.inv.txt</tt> in the <tt>hw3</tt> directory.
If you are using Eclipse, you will need to refresh the <tt>hw3</tt> directory
to see the results file in the <b>Package Browser</b>.</p>

<p>Please answer the following questions in the file
<tt>hw3/answers/problem6.txt</tt>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Examine the representation invariants Daikon generates for
  <tt>RatNum</tt> using the original test suite.  These can be found at
  the top of the <tt>daikon-RatNumTest.inv.txt</tt> file under the
  heading <tt>hw3.RatNum:::OBJECT</tt>.  Does Daikon generate the same
  invariants that are recorded in the representation invariant of
  <tt>RatNum</tt>?  How do they differ?</li>

  <li>Compare the invariants generated by Daikon at the
  entrance of the <tt>RatNum.sub</tt> method (found under the heading <tt>hw3.RatNum.sub(hw3.RatNum):::ENTER</tt>), using the two different test suites.
  How are the invariants generated by the two test suites different?
  What do the differences tell you about the test cases that are
  missing from the reduced test suite for <tt>RatNum.sub</tt>?
  That is, what case is the reduced test suite not testing?
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
You should not commit any of the Daikon-generated files to your Subversion
repository.
</p>
-->Collaboration</h3>
<p>Please answer the following questions in a file named
<tt class="western">collaboration.txt</tt> in your <tt class="western">answers/</tt>
directory.</p>
<p>The standard <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~milanova/csci2600/syllabus.htm">academic
integrity policy</a> applies to this homework. 
</p>
<p>State whether or not you collaborated with other students. If you
did collaborate with other students, state their names and a brief
description of how you collaborated. 
</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="reflection"></a>Reflection</h3>
<p>Please answer the following questions in a file named
<tt class="western">reflection.txt</tt> in your <tt class="western">answers/</tt>
directory. Answer briefly, but in enough detail to help you improve
your own practice via introspection and to enable the course staff to
improve PoS in the future.</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">In retrospect, what could you

	beginning the homework? 
	</p>
</ol>
<h3 class="western"><a name="submit"></a>What to submit</h3>
<p>By the end of the homework, you should have the following files
committed to SVN in your hw3 directory:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">answers/problem1.txt</tt>
		</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">answers/problem2.txt</tt>
		</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">answers/problem3.txt</tt>(Extra

		</p>
	<li/>
<p><tt class="western">answers/reflection.txt</tt> 
	</p>
</ul>
<p>All of the unfinished methods in RatPoly throw <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/RuntimeException.html">RuntimeException</a>s.
When you implement a method, you should be sure to remove the <code class="western">throw
new RuntimeException();</code> statement. For those of you who use
Eclipse, we have also added a <tt class="western">TODO:</tt> comment
in each of these methods. The &quot;Tasks&quot; window will give you
a list of all <tt class="western">TODO:</tt> comments, which will
help you find and complete these methods. 
</p>
<p>Think before you code! The polynomial arithmetic functions are not
difficult, but if you begin implementation without a specific plan,
it is easy to get yourself into a terrible mess. Fortunately, you did
write pseudocode for most of the polynomial arithmetic algorithms in
Homework 2. 
</p>
<p>The provided test suites in this homework are the same ones we
will use to grade your implementation; in later homeworks the staff
will not provide such a thorough set of test cases to run on your
implementations, but for this homework you can consider the provided
set of tests to be rigorous enough that <b>you do not need to write
your own tests</b>.</p>
